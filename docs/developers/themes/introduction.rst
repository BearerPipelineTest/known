Getting started writing Known themes
####################################

Themes allow you to easily extend, or provide alternatives to, Known's look and feel.

While plugins can also extend or replace Known's UI, in conjunction with extending or replacing its internal logic,
themes are a lightweight alternative.



Layout
------

The theme's folder must sit inside /Themes.

Each theme must have at least three things:

* theme.ini: a configuration file that provides information about the theme in the admin panel
* preview.png: a screenshot of the theme for use in the administration panel
* A set of templates under the theme's `templates` subfolder
