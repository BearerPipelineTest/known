Extending templates
===================

You may wish to extend templates for a variety of reasons. For example, a plugin may wish to display extra information
after the page footer, or add a new feature to user profiles.

Plugins
-------

:doc:`Plugins <../plugins/index>` extend themes

Themes
------

:doc:`Themes <../themes/index>` have a special :ref:`way of extending themes as part of their theme.ini file <themes_extending_templates>`.
